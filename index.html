			<p>Though your wicked eyebrows call
			Your nature into question
			(Unangelic's their suggestion,
			Witch whose eyes enthrall)
			</p>
			<p>I adore you still
			O foolish terrible emotion
			Kneeling in devotion
			As a priest to his idol will.
			</p>
			<p>Your undone braids conceal
			Desert, forest scents,
			In your exotic countenance
			Lie secrets unrevealed.
			</p>
			<p>Over your flesh perfume drifts
			Like incense 'round a censor,
			Tantalizing dispenser
			Of evening's ardent gifts.</p>
			<p>No Philtres could compete
			With your potent idleness:
			You've mastered the caress
			That raises dead me to their feet.</p>
			<p>Your hips themselves are romanced
			By your back and by your breasts:
			By your languid dalliance.</p>
			<p>Now and then, your appetite's
			Uncontrolled, unassuaged:
			Mysteriously enraged,	
			You kiss me and you bite.</p>
